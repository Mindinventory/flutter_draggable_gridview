        gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 2,
          childAspectRatio: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / (MediaQuery.of(context).size.height / 3),
        ),
        children: _listOfDraggableGridItem,
        isOnlyLongPress: false,
        dragCompletion: (List<DraggableGridItem> list, int beforeIndex, int afterIndex) {
          print( 'onDragAccept: $beforeIndex -> $afterIndex');
        },
        dragFeedback: (List<DraggableGridItem> list, int index) {
          return Container(
            child: list[index].child,
            width: 200,
            height: 150,
          );
        },
        dragPlaceHolder: (List<DraggableGridItem> list, int index) {
          return PlaceHolderWidget(
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          );
        },
      );
```
### Required parameters

##### gridDelegate:
A delegate that controls the layout of the children within the GridView.

##### children:
This property contains list of [DraggableGridItem] and it is use to show the widget inside the GridView.builder to provide the drag & drop functionality. Also, it contains isDraggable parameter which manages enable/disable the drag & drop functionality. 

##### dragCompletion:
This callback provides updated list and old and new indexes.


### Optional parameters

##### isOnlyLongPress:
This property contains ```bool``` value. If this property is ```false``` then it works with simple press draggable or else it works with long press. default value is 'true'. 

##### dragFeedback:
With this callback, you have to return a Widget and we will use this widget in feedback. Learn more about feedback from [Draggable](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Draggable-class.html#:~:text=Draggable%20class%20Null%20safety,user's%20finger%20across%20the%20screen) class. 

##### dragPlaceHolder:
TWith this callback, you have to return a PlaceHolderWidget and we will use this widget in place holder. 

##### dragChildWhenDragging:
With this callback, you have to return a Widget and we will display this widget instead of child when drags are under way. Learn more about childWhenDragging from [Draggable](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Draggable-class.html#:~:text=Draggable%20class%20Null%20safety,user's%20finger%20across%20the%20screen) class.


### Last But Not Least :heart_eyes: 
#### You can use all the ```GridView.builder``` properties with ```DraggableGridViewBuilder``` class.
